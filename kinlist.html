Surrounding Mai are her dogs, of which her cat is laying on her torso, on the verge of falling off, a Maitreya statue, a knight helmet she previously wore to a late Halloween activity with Yuuko, a stack of books neatly closed, and two open books lying on top of each other with their spines facing up." src="images/kins/mai3.png" height="250" width="auto">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img id="kins" alt="Mai and Yuuko's eyes lock as their faces are lit by sunset.
