  <img alt="Teto, as she appears in the music video for Machine Love by Jamie Paige. She is overlaid on a background inspired by the wallpaper seen on the MacOS default theme in MacOS 8.5, with the MacOS logo replaced with an eared robot. Unlike the previous images here, she is comprised of several colors and patterns, ranging from black-and-purple checkerboards, halftone dots on white, crosses on white, purple crosses on black, and normal dots occasionally crossing between highlights and merging with checkerboards. Overall, she is stylized much like a watercolor painting, while bordering on mixed media. She is holding a 5-string bass guitar with her right hand, loosely gripping the head, while her left hand communicates the message 'I love you' in American Sign Language. As she is mid-jump, her twindrills have gravitated upwards, again comprised of several colors along with her signature dark-pink (such as blue, green, yellow, and white highlights). This pallette is present on the rest of the piece, often acting as highlights. She is wearing a white sleeveless shirt, with her left sleeve cut cleanly and her right sleeve cut jaggedly, with two columns of parallel light-pink buttons, one at each side. She is wearing black fingerless gloves, with the right one dotted with spikes on the knuckles and wrists, and her left wrapped in a spiked bracelet. Her back has very large wings attached to it, potentially being a part of her bass guitar strap. Finally, to compliment the lyrics of the chorus, the text 'real?' with a question mark is overlaid using a blend mode on the entire piece." src="images/kins/teto3.jpg" height="250" width="auto">
