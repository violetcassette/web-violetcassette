I was drawn to his work because of his geometric style, so I decided to call the magazine "Geomonthly" to incorporate that theme of geometry, obviously making it a portmanteau of "monthly" to complete the function of a masthead.</figcaption></figure>

I utilized Adobe Illustrator very sparingly to edit vector images of iconography for operating systems of the past, making sure to use colors reflecting flags that I identify with.</figcaption></figure>

I feel as if this could pass for another Windows XP wallpaper.</figcaption></figure>

By this point, I understand how to effectively use natural light to capture detail in what I was shooting, and began experimenting with using the Manual mode of my camera.</figcaption></figure>
