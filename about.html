  <img id="notsona" alt="A horizontal banner featuring flags and symbols reflecting that of the webmaster. These include the rainbow infinity symbol, used to represent autism, the transgender pride flag designed by Monica Helms in 1999, the five-stripe lesbian pride flag derived from the 2018 seven-stripe design by Emily Gwen, the techgender xenogender flag design made by gender-plaza on Tumblr in October of 2020 and the alertgender xenogender flag, designed by the webmaster." src="/images/about/flagbanner.png">
  <a href="/images/about/sona.png"><img class="sona" alt="A reference for my sona, Violet. This alt text is incomplete and will be fleshed out with the text seen on the image when time is available." src="/images/about/scaled/sona.jpg"></a>
  <a href="/images/about/sona_detail.png"><img class="sona" alt="An alternate reference for my sona which has half-opacity layers for her breasts and hair in order to more clearly see the CRT monitor on her torso and VCRs on her back." src="/images/about/scaled/sona_detail.jpg"></a>
  <a href="/images/about/clothed.png"><img class="sona" alt="Another alternate reference for my sona which has an outfit consisting of a lavender sweater which leaves a considerable amount of cleavage visible, along with her belly below the speakers, while covering up the VCRs on her back. She is also wearing black thigh-high socks which leave her birthmarks exposed." src="/images/about/scaled/clothed.jpg"></a>
  <a href="/images/about/clothed_detail.png"><img class="sona" alt="Another alternate reference for my sona which sees her clothed, while also having half-opacity layers at her breasts and hair. However, in comparison to the previous detail alt, a pair of black panties covered by her long hair can be seen." src="/images/about/scaled/clothed_detail.jpg"></a>
